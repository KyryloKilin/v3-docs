# How to Transfer Ownership of Your Hyperlane Warp Route

# Using the Hyperlane CLI

One of the quickest way to transfer a warp route ownership is by using the [Hyperlane CLI](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/cli).

<PrerequisitesPartial />

:::info
If you followed the [Deploy a Warp Route](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/guides/deploy-warp-route) guide, you may have deployed a warp route with the owner set to the single private key. In production, it is advisable to use a multisig.
:::

To confirm using the Hyperlane CLI, locate your token symbol and the chain it is deployed on:

<WarpReadSymbolChainPartial />

You should be able to select the warp route that you wish to update the ownership for.

After running `warp read`, you should see a similar config with `owner` set to private key's address:

```yaml {3}
yourchain:
  mailbox: "0x979Ca5202784112f4738403dBec5D0F3B9daabB9"
  owner: "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
  ...
```

By default, `warp read` will save the output to `CURRENT_DIR/configs/warp-route-deployment.yaml`. Follow these steps using the CLI to transfer the existing ownership to another address.

## Step 1: Configuration
Update `owner` address in the `warp-route-deployment.yaml`

```diff title="warp-route-deployment.yaml"
yourchain:
  mailbox: '0x979Ca5202784112f4738403dBec5D0F3B9daabB9'
- owner: '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266'
+ owner: '0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045'
  interchainSecurityModule:
    address: '0xd54d32cD6a62482497252D59E6cCC1445fF0b92d'
    type: staticAggregationIsm
    modules:
      - owner: '0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266'
        address: '0xcE512189fF1BD41186E9eDda02BF321Fb1FC6eAc'
        type: defaultFallbackRoutingIsm
        domains: {}
    threshold: 1
  name: Ether
  symbol: ETH
  decimals: 18
  totalSupply: 0
  type: native

```

## Step 2: Apply

Using the CLI, execute by providing the token symbol and warp route config:

<WarpApplySymbolConfigDefaultPartial />

You should see a batch of transactions executed on chain, and a final message indicating that the warp config has been updated.

## Step 3: Confirm

To confirm that the owner was successfully updated using the Hyperlane CLI, run the following command with your token symbol and the chain it is deployed on:

<WarpReadSymbolChainPartial />

After running `warp read`, you should see a similar config with the now updated `owner`:

```yaml {3}
yourchain:
  mailbox: "0x979Ca5202784112f4738403dBec5D0F3B9daabB9"
  owner: "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
  interchainSecurityModule:
    address: "0x8af9445d8A3FbFBd1D5dF185B8a4533Ab060Cf36"
    type: staticAggregationIsm
    modules:
      - owner: "0xe738d6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb94876"
        address: "0xBe0232d5d45f9aD8322C2C4F84c39e64302Cd996"
        type: defaultFallbackRoutingIsm
        domains: {}
    threshold: 1
  name: Ether
  symbol: ETH
  decimals: 18
  totalSupply: 0
  type: native
```

By completing these steps, you have successfully transferred and verified ownership of your Warp Route to a new address.
